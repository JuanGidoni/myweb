# Juan Ignacio Gidoni Website

In this repository you can find all my own code for my personal website. Check it [here](https://github.com/JuanGidoni)

Currently, this website is under construction. 

## List of things that I want to have here

I'm improving constantly my knowledge in the Frontend area and this year I want to put all that I know, like `Hexagonal Arquitecture`, in action.

List to things:

- `Hexagonal Arquitecture`
- My own `API REST`
- `React` App with `Typescript`
- My own d`esign`
- Use `Docs as Code`
- Test Driven Development
- A plus, I will export in an `index.ts` every core features or functionalites to improve the imports (may be I'll use dynamic imports)

I will try to update everything asap or everyday.

Version 00.00.01
